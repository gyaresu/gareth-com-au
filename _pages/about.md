With over 25 years of transformational leadership leveraging synergistic cross-platform solutions to drive paradigm-shifting digital ecosystems... wait, sorry, that's my LinkedIn bio. Let me try again: I build stuff that works, fix things that break, and help organisations stop making technology harder than it needs to be. My experience spans organisations of all sizes across multiple continents, but the common thread is cutting through the bullshit to get things done. With kindness.

### My Professional Journey

Before the internet was everywhere, I worked with things you could drop on your foot: steel, concrete, and wood. I sailed. I spent time off the grid, in places where you couldn’t be reached, learning to rely on my hands, judgment, and the people beside me.

I started my career as the **Founder of Computer Rescue** in Australia, where I built a managed IT services company helping small and medium businesses with everything from day-to-day support to strategic technology planning. This taught me how to translate complex technical concepts into a strategic integration plan that put humans at the center.

I later became the **Manager of Dive Operations** at Reef Safari Diving on the Great Barrier Reef, where I managed logistics and training programs across multiple locations in Australia and Fiji. These years underwater are some of my most precious for both environmental and human reasons.

At **Greenpeace International** in Amsterdam, I led an IT support team and oversaw the transition of legacy systems to cloud platforms. This work spanned international offices, ships, and campaigns, developing solutions that kept teams connected and secure whether they were coordinating climate action from Berlin or documenting environmental destruction from a ship in the Pacific.

I then became an **International Technology Contractor**, working with organisations worldwide across Asia Pacific, Europe, and North America. This included:
- **Data Analyst**: Building automated social media analysis tools for Greenpeace's Insights Team - because manually reading every tweet about climate change would have driven us all mad.
- **IT System Migration Lead**: Overseeing system migrations, training, and security assessments for Greenpeace offices in Germany, Turkey, and Israel.
- **Security Researcher**: Solo'd a multi-year project to decode Iridium satellite signals and build fishing aggregation tracking systems. Designed and built hardware units containing computers and software-defined radios that were deployed across three Greenpeace ships to monitor illegal fishing activities.

Most recently, I was **Operations Manager and CISO** at TCSI Consulting Ltd in Canada, where I helped 200+ organisations modernise their IT systems and strengthen their security. As a virtual CIO, I worked with business leaders to make sure their technology actually supported their organisational objectives.

### Today

I’m absolutely stoked to be representing Passbolt in the APAC (Asia-Pacific) region. At Passbolt I focus on building dependable, secure software and helping teams adopt open-source password management that actually works for them.
