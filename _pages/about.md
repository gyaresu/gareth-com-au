With over 25 years in technology and operations, I specialize in helping businesses find practical, effective solutions to complex challenges. My focus is on aligning technology with real-world business goals, streamlining systems, and supporting growth with clear, strategic insights.

I’ve worked across industries, from small businesses to global organizations, bringing hands-on guidance that helps teams work more effectively together. I believe in cutting through complexity to create straightforward solutions that make technology a valuable tool for progress, not an obstacle.

At Consultancy for Strategic Innovation, I’m here to help you tackle IT and operational challenges with solutions that are designed to last. Whether you’re looking to optimize existing systems, introduce innovative practices, or prepare for future growth, I work closely with you to ensure technology is a partner in your success.
