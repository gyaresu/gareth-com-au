With over 25 years in IT leadership and a track record spanning diverse industries and countries, I bring deep expertise in technology consulting, digital transformation, and strategic IT management. My experience ranges from hands-on technical roles to executive advisory, and I have worked with organizations of all sizes - from nonprofits to large corporations and government agencies.

### My Professional Journey

Before the internet was everywhere, I worked with things you could drop on your foot: steel, concrete, and wood. I sailed. I spent time off the grid, in places where you couldn’t be reached, learning to rely on my hands, judgment, and the people beside me.

I started my career as the **Founder of Computer Rescue** in Australia, where I provided IT support and advisory services to small and medium-sized businesses. This role built the foundation for my approach to practical, adaptable tech solutions tailored to unique business needs.

I later became the **Manager of Dive Operations** at Reef Safari Diving on the Great Barrier Reef, where I honed my leadership skills managing logistics and training programs across multiple locations in Australia and Fiji. This experience in operations management informed my ability to handle complex projects and coordinate cross-functional teams.

In my role as **Team Lead for Information Technology** at Greenpeace International in Amsterdam, I led an IT support team and oversaw the transition of legacy systems to cloud platforms. This work spanned international offices, ships, and campaigns, developing solutions that empowered teams globally and securely.

I then transitioned to an **International Technology Contractor**, where I collaborated with organizations worldwide, including nonprofits and corporations in the Asia Pacific, Europe, and North America. Key roles included:
- **Data Analyst**: Automating social media analysis for the GPI Insights Team.
- **IT System Migration Lead**: Overseeing migrations, training, and security assessments for offices in Turkey and Israel.
- **Security Researcher**: Conducting embedded hardware and radio security research, designing testing equipment, and implementing secure communication solutions.

Most recently, I served as **Operations Manager and CISO** at TCSI Consulting Ltd in Canada, where I led digital transformation initiatives, modernized IT infrastructure, and developed cybersecurity frameworks for 200+ organizations. As a virtual CIO for major clients, I worked closely with stakeholders to align technology with business goals, supporting remote work, automation, and efficient, secure IT operations.

### Today

I’m absolutely stoked to be representing Passbolt across Oceania - the best region on the planet. At Passbolt I focus on building dependable, secure software and helping teams adopt open-source password management that actually works for them.

Previously I ran my own consulting practice and have worked across Australia, North America, Europe, and the broader Asia–Pacific, delivering practical engineering and systems outcomes.
